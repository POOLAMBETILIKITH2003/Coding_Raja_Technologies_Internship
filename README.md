## Budget Tracker

The project is to develop a console-based budget tracker, a program that enables users to manage their expenses and income directly through a text-based interface. 

It aims to provide functionalities such as expense and income entry, budget calculation, expense analysis, and data persistence.

Let's break down the features:

**Expense and Income Entry:**

   Users should be able to input their expenses and income into the system. 
   
   This input should include details such as the category of the transaction (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment, salary), as well as the amount. 
   
   The system must handle both expenses and income separately and ensure accurate recording of transactions.

**Budget Calculation:**

   The system should calculate the remaining budget after deducting expenses from the income. 
   
   This involves keeping track of the total income and subtracting the total expenses to determine the remaining amount. 
   
   The remaining budget should be dynamically updated as new transactions are added.

**Expense Analysis:**

   Users should be provided with insights into their spending habits. 
   
   This can be achieved by categorizing expenses and displaying spending trends over time. 
   
   For example, the system might show users what percentage of their income is being spent on different categories such as food, utilities, entertainment, etc., 
   
   This analysis helps users understand where their money is going and where they might need to adjust their spending habits.

**Data Persistence:**
   
   Transactions entered by the users should be stored in a file or database for tracking over time.
   
   This ensures that users can access their transaction history and track their financial progress over time. 
   
   Data persistence also enables features such as generating reports, setting financial goals, and providing personalized recommendations based on past spending patterns.

### Implementation of the Project

To implement this project, you would need to design and develop a console-based application using a programming language such as Python, Java, or C++. 

You would need to create classes or data structures to represent transactions, implement algorithms for budget calculation and expense analysis, and integrate a method for data persistence, such as file I/O or database management.

The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to input transactions, view their budget status, and access spending analysis with minimal effort. 

Additionally, error handling should be implemented to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application, such as validating user input and handling exceptions gracefully.

Overall, the goal of the project is to provide users with a simple yet effective tool for managing their finances, helping them track their expenses, stay within budget, and make informed financial decisions.
